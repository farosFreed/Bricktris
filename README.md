## QA Test Checklist

When pushing a new version to production, do these QA checks first.

In both Chrome & Firefox:

- Test creating / deleting an item
- Test completing an item
- Test rotating and moving on desktop and mobile devices
- Test reloading the tab to see that data has persisted

## Developer TODO List

- Jest Tests
- Github Actions: runs tests, create documentation (w/ Husky?)
- Do something with graphQL query component?
- Write a toggleable AI to auto-play the game?
